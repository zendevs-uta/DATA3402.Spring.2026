    "You are used to data types like strings and floats and the operations you can do on them, for example\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.0 + 2.5 → 3.5\n",
    "    “Hello” + “ “ + “World” → “Hello World”\n",
    "   \n",
    "What if you wanted new type of data with operations that are unique to it? For example the Matrices. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix}3 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} →\n",

    "## Object Oriented Programming\n",

    "*Encapsulate* data and the operations into a new concept called an object. An object\n",
    "   * has a *type* referred to as a **class**, analogous to “float” or “string”.\n",
    "   * holds *data* in form of fields or **attributes** (sometimes referred to as **properties**). \n",
    "   * holds *code* in form of **methods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, lets say we want to keep information on students in this class for computing grades. We can create a new class of object called a “student”:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Attributes**: name, id number, year, grades, …\n",
    "   * **Methods**: add_grade, average_grade, …\n",
